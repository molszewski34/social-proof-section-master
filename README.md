## Motivation
When i started my journey with frontend i tried to get as much knowledge as possible. You probably know a mighty feeling where you must know all the basics and stuff, so you jump from one tutorial to another and then you spend months on it and then you start to write by yourself and you realize you just don't remember what you saw. This challange wasnt my first but it one many (not yet uploaded) i made to understand a basics. I am not totaly proud of the result but whose first projects are perfect :)
